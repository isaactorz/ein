# Ein

Ein is a library of reusable C++ software components in the spirit of boost, abseil, folly, etc..

It is also my personal C++ sandbox, where I experiment with bleeding edge language features. As such Ein isn't concerned with avoiding re-inventing the wheel, being overly performance concered (a la Knuth), or overly general/complex.

Ein does aim to be cross-platform (windows, macos, linux), show off my C++ chops, and hopefully contain some nuggets other find interesting and/or useful.
